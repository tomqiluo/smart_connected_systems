Hi everyone, we are team three.

Here is the demo for our final quest.

As you can see, with one click the LEDs on the buggy is activated. Double click and the buggy will turn left. With three clicks, the buggy will turn right.

Eventually, with 4 clicks, the buggy will do a trick. It will randomly go backward and forward. Just like dancing. We were inspired by tesla when we created this trick.

This is our final quest, and I just want to thank everyone who has devoted their energy, patience, and hard work to this course. We really enjoyed it and learned a lot.
